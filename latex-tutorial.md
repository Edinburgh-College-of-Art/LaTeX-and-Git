# LaTeX Tutorial


## 1. Creating a project

- Use a TeX editor to begin with
  - the tex file is just a text file: anything that edits text can be use to write a TeX document

For a TeX file to build we need is

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\title{Title}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\end{document}
```

For the proposal and final submission, you will be provided with a LaTeX template
