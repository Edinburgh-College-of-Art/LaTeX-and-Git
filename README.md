# LaTeX-and-Git
##### using LaTeX with a git repo

[The Wikibook for LaTeX is a fantastic resource](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX). Here is some basic info to get you started.

## 1. Creating a project

- Use a TeX editor to begin with
  - the tex file is just a text file: anything that edits text can be use to write a TeX document

For a TeX file to build we need is

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\title{Title}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\end{document}
```

For the proposal and final submission, you will be provided with a LaTeX template


`.tex` files are essentially just text files. Just like this file `README.md`, which is a markdown file, `.tex` files are just text with TeX commands. It is recommended that you install a LaTeX distribution as suggested in [the setup page](https://edinburgh-college-of-art.github.io/2019-04-15-gitcarp/). TeX packages just ensure you have a tex compiler installed. You can edit your tech file in whichever plain text editor you are comfortable with. [You can even use LaTeX in atom](https://gist.github.com/Aerijo/5b9522530715e5be6e89fc012e9a72a8)

## 2. Building the file

The compiler you use may have some effect on the final look of your file. `pdflatex` is the recommended compiler for your submission. You should build the file from time to time to make sure that there are no errors. Try not to ignore errors for too long as you will have to fix them at some point.

## 3. BiBTeX

Like tex files, BiBTeX files are just text with a specific format. It is recommended that you use a bibliography management app like [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org) or BibDesk for macOS

Discover ed, export to bibtex, utf-8 encoding

## 4. [Figures](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions)

Figures are always in the form:

```latex
\begin{figure}[placement_specifier]   
     \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{path/to/file}
   \caption{Caption Text}
\end{figure}
```
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Specifier
</th>
<th>Permission
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>h</code>
</td>
<td>Place the float <i>here</i>, i.e., <i>approximately</i> at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not <i>exactly</i> at the spot)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>t</code>
</td>
<td>Position at the <i>top</i> of the page.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>b</code>
</td>
<td>Position at the <i>bottom</i> of the page.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>p</code>
</td>
<td>Put on a special <i>page</i> for floats only.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>!</code>
</td>
<td>Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining "good" float positions.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><code>H</code>
</td>
<td>Places the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. Requires the <span style="font-family: monospace; color: #2020C0; font-weight: normal;">float</span> package. i.e., <code class="mw-highlight" dir="ltr"><span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="nb">{</span>float<span class="nb">}</span></code>.
</td></tr></tbody></table>


## [Equations](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics)

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Function
</th>
<th>Description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>`_{...}`
</td>
<td>Subscript
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>`^{...}`
</td>
<td>Superscript
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>`\[ ... \]`
</td>
<td>equation display
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>`/( ... /)`
</td>
<td>inline equation
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>`\frac{n}{d}`
</td>
<td>fraction with a numerator `n` and denominator `d`
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## 3. LaTeX and Git


Using LaTeX and git together, take heed of the following.

Use a `.gitignore` to avoid committing files generated by LaTeX. There is a TeX ignore template when creating a `.gitignore` file.


## Spell Checking

For spell checking in LaTeX, [check here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tips_and_Tricks#Spell-checking_and_Word_Counting)

### macOS
1. Start Terminal
2. If Homebrew is not installed run:
  `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null`

#### ispell
3. `brew install ispell`
#### aspell
3. `brew install aspell`
#### hunspell
3. `brew install hunspell`

### Windows

### Linux
- `apt-get install ispell`
- `apt-get install aspell`
- `apt-get install hunspell`
